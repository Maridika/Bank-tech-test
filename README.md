# Bank-tech-test

This project demonstrates the work of basic banking account - withdrawal, deposit, statement 
It is written on Java script, Node JS
It is written from scratch. The main problem was formatting the statement look and sorting the output. I used Eslint to spot potential problems, which are now partially fixed.
I plan to do refactoring the code in the future, in accordance with full assesment criteria.
I also want to add more tests to make a better code coverage.
